need help creating an application
the user will be a child
important that once the application is started, it is difficult to exit
	built-in windows keystrokes to terminate programs--such as alt-f4--should be accepted
	the windows key should be disabled while the program is active
will be a full screen application
able to be run from windows
require specific multi-key keystroke to exit the program

on startup:
blank screen with black background color
flashing cursor which is light blue in color
accept certain keystrokes and print corresponding letter or key name to the screen; printed keystrokes are also light blue, same as cursor
the Enter key should create a line break
if keys such as f1, f2, print screen, scroll lock, etc. (non-alphanumeric, non-punctuation) are pressed, print the name of the key in capital letters (F1, F2, PRTSC, SCRLK, etc.)

before you get started on coding, use best judgment given the provided circumstances to select a coding language. explain your choice of coding language.

great start. a few things to please resolve.

let's have text start from the center and break to new line when the screen is 66% full of text
let's make text real big. 120 point
when enter is pressed, there should be a blank line added, with text starting on the line after the blank line
let's disable print screen key while app is open; when i press it now, i get the print screen dialog
let's remove arrow keys from the set of "special" keys. arrow keys should now move the cursor around
the "special" keys are not working properly. only DEL works. others have no effect or serve their usual function. their usual function should not be performed.
when the screen is filled with text, clear the text and put the cursor back at top middle of the screen.
